# Brain-Cancer-Gene-Expression-Classification
This project classifies brain cancer using gene expression data. It includes preprocessing, handling missing values, class balancing, feature selection, and training models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM) in pipelines to compare performance to better insights in biomedical informatics and cancer research.
